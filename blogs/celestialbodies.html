            <h1>Building an Interactive Celestial Body Simulation (Part 1)</h1>
            <p>
                I recently developed a program that simulates the attractive force of two objects in space time using
                Newtonian Mechanics. In this post, I will walk you through my proccess of building this program.
            </p>
            <h2>0. Preface</h2>
            <p>
                 My original (and current) idea for this project was/is to create a video game like simuation software 
                 for users to see how any number of bodies in space would interact with eachother. The current iteration
                 is not quite there yet, I still have to refine some bugs, and develop an interative platform that 
                 makes it easy for even a young child to play with.
            </p>
            <h2>1. Defining the Problem</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this project is to create a simulation that models the gravitational forces between
                two celestial bodies and tracks their motion over time. I knew it would be more of a challenge
                for me to code the project than it would be to define the mathematics, so I brushed up on some
                Python libraries that I planned to use, like matplotlib.

            </p>
                <p>
                    First, let's start with what I know best, the mechanics:
                    I am using Newtonian Mechanics for this problem even though they are known to not work for
                    very large masses, like black holes. But since I don't know General Relativity, this is the 
                    best it's gonna get (for now).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The majority of the heavy lifting is done by the Inverse Square Law:
                </p>
                <p>
                    \[ \vec{\mathbf{F}} = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{\vec{\mathbf{R}}^2} \]
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    where
                </p>
                
                <p>
                     \[ \vec{\mathbf{R}} = x\vec{\mathbf{i}} + y\vec{\mathbf{j}} \] 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Next we define some basic kinematic equations, which are updated with small time steps given
                    by the Inverse Square Law defined above. I used:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    \[ \vec{\mathbf{v}}(t) = \vec{\mathbf{a}}t \]
                </p>
                
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    and
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    \[ \vec{\mathbf{r}}(t) = \vec{\mathbf{v}}t + \frac{1}{2} \vec{\mathbf{a}}t^2 \]
                </p>
                <p>
                    For sake of completeness, I will also define how I computed the x and y components of the force vector:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    \[ F_x = \vec{\mathbf{F}} \frac{x_2 - x_1}{|\vec{\mathbf{R}}|} \]
                </p>
                
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    and
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    \[ F_y = \vec{\mathbf{F}} \frac{y_2 - y_1}{|\vec{\mathbf{R}}|} \]
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Where \( x_2 \) and \( y_2 \) correspond to the position of the second body, and \( x_1 \) and \( y_1 \) to the first body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now lets move onto the code...
                </p>
    
            <h2>2. Designing the Classes and Methods</h2>
            <p>
                The key part of the design is the <code>CelestialBody</code> class. Each celestial body has a
                mass, position, and velocity. These are initialized in the constructor, and the class includes
                methods for updating the body's position and velocity:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
class CelestialBody:
    def __init__(self, mass, position, velocity):
        self.mass = mass
        self.position = np.array(position, dtype=float)
        self.velocity = np.array(velocity, dtype=float)
    
    def update_position(self, dt, acceleration):
        self.position += self.velocity * dt + 0.5 * acceleration * dt ** 2

    def update_velocity(self, dt, acceleration_new, acceleration_old):
        self.velocity += 0.5 * (acceleration_old + acceleration_new) * dt
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The <code>update_position</code> method, as its name suggests, updates the position based
                on velocity and acceleration, while the <code>update_velocity</code> method updates the velocity
                using the average of old and new accelerations.
            </p>
            <h2>3. Gravitational Force Calculation</h2>
            <p>
                The next crucial part of the simulation was computing the gravitational force between two bodies.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
def compute_gravitational_force(body1, body2, G):
    r_vec = body2.position - body1.position
    r_mag = np.linalg.norm(r_vec) + 1e-10  # Prevent division by zero
    F_mag = G * body1.mass * body2.mass / r_mag ** 2
    F_vec = F_mag * (r_vec / r_mag)
    return F_vec
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                This uses the Inverse Square Law which we defined earlier.
            </p>
            <h2>4. Integrating the Motion</h2>
            <p>
                Once the forces are calculated, I used the Verlet integration method to update the positions and velocities of the celestial
                bodies step by step. The <code>step</code> function performs these calculations and updates for
                each time step:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
def step(dt, body1, body2, G):
    F12 = compute_gravitational_force(body1, body2, G)
    a1_old = F12 / body1.mass
    a2_old = -F12 / body2.mass

    body1.update_position(dt, a1_old)
    body2.update_position(dt, a2_old)

    F12_new = compute_gravitational_force(body1, body2, G)
    a1_new = F12_new / body1.mass
    a2_new = -F12_new / body2.mass

    body1.update_velocity(dt, a1_new, a1_old)
    body2.update_velocity(dt, a2_new, a2_old)
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                This approach models the interactions step-by-step in a loop, allowing us to animate the motion
                of the bodies.
            </p>
            <h2>5. Animating the Simulation</h2>
            <p>
                To visualize the motion, I used <code>matplotlib.animation</code> to create an animation. The
                positions of the celestial bodies are updated over time, and trails are drawn to show their paths:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
anim = FuncAnimation(fig, animate, init_func=init, interval=20, blit=True)
plt.show()
            </code></pre>

            <video controls style="width:100%; max-width:600px;">
                <source src="../docs/orbit_animation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            
            <p>
                The result is a dynamic animation showing the gravitational dance between the two bodies. The
                animation also includes trails to track the movement of the Moon relative to Earth.
            </p>
            <h2>In The End...</h2>
            <p>
                This project was a great exercise in understanding gravitational dynamics and implementing numerical
                integration techniques, but it is far from done. I still need to implement support for multiple bodies
                as well as an interactive front end for ease of use. Plan to see more blog posts about this project in the
                future. To see the full project, you can visit the 
                <a href="https://github.com/m0zzaR/ThreeBodyProblem" target="_blank">repository on my GitHub</a>.
