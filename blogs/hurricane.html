            <h1>Modeling a Hurricane, Defining Sudo-Forces and Understanding the Corriolis Effect</h1>

            <h2>0. Preface</h2>

            <p>
                Hurricanes are a very interesting force of nature that arise party because of something you might not ever expect, the rotation of the Earth.
                That's right, hurricanes wouldn't form if it weren't for the spin of the Earth, well neither would you for that matter... but this is besides the
                point.
            </p>

            <p>
                By the end of this blog I hope that both you and I will have a deeper, more mathematical understanding of hurricanes and how they behave. Naturally
                following from that we will also better understand of mysterious sudo-forces, like the Corriolis effect.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Defining the Problem</h2>

            <p>
                A hurricane forms when a low-pressure zone develops at a point
                on the earth, which then attracts the air to it. But due to the earth’s rotation, the
                pseudoforces that influence the air particles as they attract to the low-pressure zone cause
                the air to swirl.

                
            </p>

            <p>
                We will make this problem more tractable by assuming the earth is a flat disk (no
                conspiracy theories please!) spinning at some arbritray rate.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let us assume the low-pressure center has a
                position vector  that is fixed to a particular location on the earth \( \mathbf{r}_0(t) \) away from the
                “North pole,” which is the center of the disk. Suppose the low-pressure zone establishes a
                vector field that we can imagine pulls on parcels of air with a force \[ \mathbf{F}_p(\mathbf{r}, t) = -F_0(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0(t))  \] 
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">
                where \(F_0\) = [N/m]

            </p>

            <p>
                Let's imagine a single particle of air which is initially moving with the earth. These air particles also
                experience a drag force when they move relative to the earth’s surface:
                \[ \mathbf{F}_d = -c_s(\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{v}_e(t))  \] 
            </p>

            <p>
                where \(\mathbf{v}\) is the velocity of the air particle and \(\mathbf{v}_e(t)\) is the velocity of the Earth at the poistion of the particle.

            </p>

            <p>
                Before we solve this problem, we have to ask a fundamental question: Are these the only forces acting on the parcel of air? (Not including gravity)
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, no... There are three of what physicists call "sudo-forces" in this problem. These forces, like the name impies, are not really real, and they definitely are not fundamental. 
                While the force of a low-pressure zone, and the force of drag on the particles of air are well defined and easy to understand, sudo-forces are much more vague and 
                mysterious. In order to understand the problem better, lets define what sudo-forces are.
            </p>
