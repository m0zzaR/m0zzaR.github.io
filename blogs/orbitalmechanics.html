                    This blog will serve as the mathematical groundwork for future implementations of my <a href="https://github.com/m0zzaR/ThreeBodyProblem" target="_blank">Three Body Problem</a> project.
                    In order to create an accurate simulation, one should have a deep understanding of the physics behind it. All of the mathematics used here were learned in my

                </p>
                
                <h2>1. Orbital Mechanics</h2>
    
                <p>
                    Let's begin our exploration by considering a celestial body that is most familiar to us: the Earth.
                    If we want to analyze the interaction between Earth, a very massive object, and a satellite, we assume that \( m \ll M_e \); in other words,
                    the mass of the satellite is so much smaller than the mass of the Earth that its gravitational effect on Earth is negligible.
                    We'll also assume that the center of mass of the Earth rests at the origin \((0, 0)\), and the position of the satellite is at some distance \(\mathbf{r}(t)\).
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    First, let's define our kinematics in Cartesian coordinates for a three-dimensional space:
                </p>
                <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    \begin{cases}
                    \mathbf{r} = x\,\mathbf{e}_x + y\,\mathbf{e}_y + z\,\mathbf{e}_z \\
                    \mathbf{v} = \dot{\mathbf{r}} = \dot{x}\,\mathbf{e}_x + \dot{y}\,\mathbf{e}_y + \dot{z}\,\mathbf{e}_z \\
                    \mathbf{a} = \dot{\mathbf{v}} = \ddot{x}\,\mathbf{e}_x + \ddot{y}\,\mathbf{e}_y + \ddot{z}\,\mathbf{e}_z
                    \end{cases}
                    \]
                </div>

                <p>
                    Next, we define the gravitational force that the satellite feels from the Earth using Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:
                </p>

                <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    \mathbf{F}_g = -G\,\frac{M_e m}{|\mathbf{r}|^3}\,\mathbf{r}
                    \]
                </div> 

                <p>
                    Where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M_e \) is the mass of the Earth, and \( m \) is the mass of the satellite.
                    The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive, directed towards the Earth.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    For simplicity, let's define:
                </p>

                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[ B = G M_e \]
                    </div>

                <p>Applying Newton's second law, we sum the forces acting on the satellite:</p>
                    
                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    m\mathbf{a} = -B\,\frac{m\,\mathbf{r}}{|\mathbf{r}|^3}
                    \]
                    </div>

                <p>
                    Dividing both sides by \( m \), we obtain the equation of motion:
                </p>
                    
                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    \mathbf{a} = -B\,\frac{\mathbf{r}}{|\mathbf{r}|^3}
                    \]
                    </div>

                <p>
                    This is known as the trajectory equation. Since the gravitational force exerted by the satellite on Earth is negligible due to the mass difference, we omit it from our equation.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    We can also express the gravitational force as the gradient of a potential energy function, which allows us to calculate quantities like escape velocity:\
                </p>
                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    \mathbf{F}_g = -\nabla U_g
                    \]
                    </div>
                <p>
                    Where the gravitational potential energy \( U_g \) is given by:
                </p>
                    
                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    U_g = -\frac{B m}{|\mathbf{r}|}
                    \]
                    </div>
                
    
                <p>
                    Using the work-energy theorem, we can derive the escape velocityâ€”the minimum velocity needed for the satellite to escape Earth's gravitational field:
                </p>
                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    \begin{cases}
                    E_{\text{initial}} = \dfrac{1}{2} m v_e^2 - \dfrac{B m}{|\mathbf{r}|} \\
                    E_{\text{final}} = 0
                    \end{cases}
                    \]
                    </div>

                    <p> 
                        Where \( E_{\text{final}} = 0 \) because both kinetic and potential energies are zero at infinity.
                        Setting \( E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}} \) and solving for \( v_e \), we find:
                    </p>


                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    v_e = \sqrt{\dfrac{2 B}{|\mathbf{r}|}}
                    \]
                    </div>
                <p>
                    For Earth's surface, this gives an escape velocity of approximately \( 11,200\, \text{m/s} \).
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    However, the work-energy theorem alone does not provide information about the trajectory of the satellite since it deals with scalar quantities.
                    To gain more insight into the orbital path, we can invoke the conservation of angular momentum:
                </p>
                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    \mathbf{H} = m\,\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v}
                    \]
                    </div>
                <p>
                    Importantly, the position vector \( \mathbf{r} \) and the velocity vector \( \mathbf{v} \) lie in the same plane, meaning the motion is planar.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Let's express \( \mathbf{r} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \) in polar coordinates:
                </p>

                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    \begin{cases}
                    \mathbf{r} = r\,\mathbf{e}_r \\
                    \mathbf{v} = \dot{r}\,\mathbf{e}_r + r\,\dot{\theta}\,\mathbf{e}_\theta
                    \end{cases}
                    \]
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The angular momentum then becomes:
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    \mathbf{H} = m\,\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v} = m\,r\,\mathbf{e}_r \times \left( \dot{r}\,\mathbf{e}_r + r\,\dot{\theta}\,\mathbf{e}_\theta \right) = m\,r^2\,\dot{\theta}\,\mathbf{e}_z
                    \]
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Since \( \mathbf{H} \) is conserved, we can write:
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    H_0 = m\,r^2\,\dot{\theta}
                    \]
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Which implies:</p>
                    
                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    \dot{\theta} = \dfrac{H_0}{m\,r^2}
                    \]
                    </div>

    
                <p>
                    Next, we'll derive the orbit equation using conservation of energy and angular momentum.
                    The total mechanical energy \( E \) is given by:
                </p>
                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    E = \dfrac{1}{2} m v^2 - \dfrac{B m}{r} = \dfrac{1}{2} m \left( \dot{r}^2 + (r\,\dot{\theta})^2 \right) - \dfrac{B m}{r}
                    \]
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Substituting \( r\,\dot{\theta} = \dfrac{H_0}{m\,r} \), we get:
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="math-display">

                    \]
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Rearranging terms, we can write:
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    \dfrac{d r}{d t} = \dot{r}, \quad \text{and} \quad \dfrac{d \theta}{d t} = \dot{\theta} = \dfrac{H_0}{m r^2}
                    \]
                    \[
                    \dfrac{d r}{d \theta} = \dfrac{\dot{r}}{\dot{\theta}} = \dfrac{r^4 \dot{r}}{H_0/m}

                    <p>
                        By further manipulation and solving the resulting differential equation, we arrive at the orbit equation:

                <p>
                    Offset angle \( \phi \) is determined by initial conditions.
                </p>
    
                <h2>2. Orbital Geometry</h2>
    
                <p>
                    The orbit equation defines conic sectionsâ€”circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbolaâ€”based on the value of the eccentricity \( e \).
                </p>
                <img src="../docs/conic-section.jpg" alt="Conic Sections" style="width:100%; max-width:600px;">
                <p>
                    - When \( e = 0 \), the orbit is a circle.<br>
                    - When \( 0 < e < 1 \), the orbit is an ellipse.<br>
                    - When \( e = 1 \), the orbit is a parabola.<br>
                    - When \( e > 1 \), the orbit is a hyperbola.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    For elliptical orbits (which is the case for most planets and satellites), the closest point to the focus (Earth) is the periapsis \( r_p \), and the farthest point is the apoapsis \( r_a \).
                    These are given by:
                </p>
                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    r_p = \dfrac{P}{1 + e} \quad (\theta = 0)
                    \]
                    \[
                    r_a = \dfrac{P}{1 - e} \quad (\theta = \pi)
                    \]
                    </div>

                <p>
                    The eccentricity can also be expressed in terms of \( r_p \) and \( r_a \):
                </p>
                    
                    <div class="math-display">
                    \[
                    e = \dfrac{r_a - r_p}{r_a + r_p}
                    \]
                    </div>
                
    
                <p>
                    Understanding these parameters allows us to characterize the shape and size of the orbit.

            <h2> Kepler's Laws </h2>

            <p>
                Johannes Kepler formulated three laws that describe planetary motion. Let's explore the second and third laws, which relate to our derivations.
            </p>

            <h3>Kepler's Second Law: Equal Areas in Equal Times</h3>

            <p>
                Kepler's second law states that a line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
                This is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum.
            </p>

            <p>
                The area \( A \) swept out from time \( t_1 \) to \( t_2 \) is given by:
                <div class="math-display">
                \[
                A = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \dfrac{1}{2} r^2\, d\theta = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \dfrac{1}{2} r^2\, \dot{\theta}\, dt
                \]
                </div>
                Substituting \( \dot{\theta} = \dfrac{H_0}{m r^2} \):
                <div class="math-display">
                \[
                A = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \dfrac{1}{2} r^2\, \left( \dfrac{H_0}{m r^2} \right)\, dt = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \dfrac{H_0}{2 m}\, dt
                \]
                </div>
                Therefore:
                <div class="math-display">
                \[
                A_{\text{slice}} = \dfrac{H_0}{2 m} (t_2 - t_1)
                \]
                </div>
                This shows that the area swept out is directly proportional to the time elapsed, confirming Kepler's second law.

            <h3>Kepler's Third Law: The Orbital Period</h3>

            <p>
                To find the total orbital period \( T \), we calculate the area of the entire ellipse and use the relationship from Kepler's second law.
            </p>
            
            <div class="math-display">
                \[
                A = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{1}{2} \hat{r}(\theta)^2 \, d\theta
                \]
                \[
                A = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{1}{2} [\frac{P}{1 + eCos(\theta - \phi)}]^2 \, d\theta
                \]
                \[
                A_\text{ellipse} = \frac{\pi P^2}{(1-e)^{3/2}}
                \]
            </div>
            
            <p> Now if we set \(A_\text{slice} = A_\text{ecclipse}\) we can solve for the total time it takes to make a full orbit:</p>

            <div class="math-display">
                \[
                \frac{H_0}{2m}(t_2 - t_1) = \frac{\pi P^2}{(1-e)^{3/2}}
                \]
            </div>
            <p style="text-align: center;";>
                Where
            </p>
            <div class="math-display">
                \[
                \frac{H}{m} = \sqrt{BP}
                \]
                \[
                \delta t_\text{total} = \frac{2\pi P^{3/2}}{\sqrt{B}} (\frac{1}{(1-e)^{3/2}})
                \]
                \[
                \delta t_\text{total} = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{B}}r_a^{3/2}
                \]

            <h2> Vis - Viva Equation </h2>

            <p>
                The vis-viva equation, also referred to as orbital-energy-invariance law,
                 is one of the equations that model the motion of orbiting bodies. It is the 
                 direct result of the principle of conservation of mechanical energy which 
                 applies when the only force acting on an object is its own weight. - Wikipedia
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's derive it:
            </p>

            <div class="math-display">
                \[
                m r_a v_a = m r_p v_p
                \]
                \[
                v_p = \frac{r_a}{r_p}v_a
                \]
            </div>


            <p> Using Work-Energy:</p>

            <div class="math-display">
                \[
                E_0 = \frac{1}{2}m(\frac{r_a}{r_p}v_a)^2 - \frac{Bm}{r_p}
                \]
                \[
                1/2mv_a^2 = E_0 + \frac{Bm}{r_a}
                \]
                \[
                E_0 = -\frac{Bm}{r_a + r_b} = -\frac{Bm}{2a}
                \]
            </div>

            <p>
                So the total energy in any elliptical orbit is given only from the 
                "max width" of the ellipse. Plugging this back into the energy balance
                and equating the energy at an arbritray point on the path:
            </p>

            <div class="math-display">
                \[
                -\frac{Bm}{2a} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{Bm}{r}
                \]
                \[
                v = \sqrt{B(\frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a})}
                \]
            </div>


            <p>
                Gives you the so called "Vis Viva Equation". So what is this equation used for? Well, 
                it is very useful for orbital maneuvering because it tells you how the orbit
                changes with speed using only the value of the distance 
                of the body from the focci (r), and the semi major axis (a). Neat huh...
            </p>
            <p>
                Keep in mind though that this equation can only be used when the mass of the orbiting body
                is MUCH smaller than the body located at one of the focci. 
            </p>

            <h2> In the End: </h2>

            <p>
                In this blog post, we have explored the fundamental principles of orbital mechanics, including Newton's law of universal gravitation, conservation of energy, and conservation of angular momentum.
                We derived the orbit equation, examined orbital geometry, discussed Kepler's laws, and introduced the Vis-Viva equation.
                These concepts form the mathematical foundation necessary for simulating celestial bodies and understanding their motions.
