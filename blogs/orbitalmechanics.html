            <p>
                This blog will act as the mathematical ground work for future implementations of my <a href="https://github.com/m0zzaR/ThreeBodyProblem" target="_blank">Three Body Problem</a>. project.
                In order to make a accurate simulation, one should have a deep understand of the physics behind the simulation. All of the math used here was learned in my 
                <a href="https://github.com/m0zzaR/Engineering-Mechanics-2" target="_blank">Engineering Mechanics</a> class. Derived and taught by <a href="https://me.berkeley.edu/people/ken-kamrin/" target="_blank">Prof. Ken Kamrin.</a>

            <h2>1. Orbital Mechancis</h2>

            <p>
                Let's start our jounrey of understanding the Universive by taking into consideration a celestial body that is most familiar to us, the Earth.
                If we want to analzye the interaction between our Earth, a very massive object, and a satilite. We say that \(m << M_e\), in english
                this just means that the mass of the satilite is so much smaller than the mass of the Earth that it is inconsiquential. Let's also asume that the center
                of mass of the Earth rests at the origin (0,0) and the mass of the satilite is at some distance \(\mathbf{r}(t)\).
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's first define our simple Cartesian Kinematics for a 3 dimensional space:

                \[
                \begin{cases}
                \mathbf{r} = x\mathbf{e}_x + y\mathbf{e}_y + z\mathbf{e}_z \\
                \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{\dot{r}} = \dot{x}\mathbf{e}_x + \dot{y}\mathbf{e}_y + \dot{z}\mathbf{e}_z \\
                \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{\dot{v}} = \ddot{x}\mathbf{e}_x + \ddot{y}\mathbf{e}_y + \ddot{z}\mathbf{e}_z
                \end{cases}
                \]

                Next we define the force the satelite feels from the mass of the Earth, as Newton's Inverse Square Law:

                \[
                \mathbf{F}_g = G\frac{M_em}{|\mathbf{r}|^2}[\frac{-\mathbf{r}}{|\mathbf{r}|}]
                \]

                Now, for simplicities sake, let's define:

                \[B = GM_e\]

                And sum the forces:
                \[
                \sum\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a} \sim -B\frac{\mathbf{r}}{|\mathbf{r}|^3}  = \mathbf{a}
                \]

                This is called the "trajectory equation". Note also that since the force the satelite exerts on the Earth is extremely small, we can omit it from our equation of acceleration.

            </p>

            <p>
                We can also define \(\mathbf{F}_g\) as a potential, which will allow us to calculate the escape velocity on Earth:

                \[
                \mathbf{F}_g = -\nabla \mathbf{U}_g
                \]
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                Where
            </p>

            <p>
                \[
                U_g = -B\frac{m}{|\mathbf{r}|}
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the work energy theorem:
                \[
                \frac{1}{2}mv^2 -B\frac{m}{|\mathbf{r}|} = constant
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                Setting the constant to 0 in this case signifies just enough energy to reach inifinty, so lets do that and solve for v:

                \[
                v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2B}{|\mathbf{r}|}} = 11,200 \frac{m}{s}
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                Unforunately, the Work and Energy theorum cannot tell us anything about trajectories since \(v_e\) is a magnitude and not a vector. 
                In order to get more details lets augment this with another conservation law, Angular Momentum:

                \[
                \mathbf{H} = m\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v}
                \]

                It is important to note here, that \(\mathbf{r}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) always lie in the same plane. Two objects in space will always have 
                a velocity and distance vectors that are perpendicular to eachother. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's find some explicit expressions for \(\mathbf{r}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) using Kinematics in polar coordinates:

                \[
                \begin{cases}
                \mathbf{r} = r\mathbf{e}_r \\
                \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{\dot{r}} = \dot{r}\mathbf{e}_r + r\dot{\theta}\mathbf{e}_\theta  \\
                \end{cases}
                \]

            </p>

            <p>
                Now \(\mathbf{H}\) can be expressed as such:

                \[
                \mathbf{H} = mr\mathbf{e}_r \times (\dot{r}\mathbf{e}_r + r\dot{\theta}\mathbf{e}_\theta)
                \]
                \[
                mr^2\dot{\theta}\mathbf{e}_z = H_0\mathbf{e}_z
                \]
                \[
                \dot{\theta} = \frac{H_0}{mr^2}
                \]

            </p>

            <p>
                After this point, I cannot really explain what my professor did or why he did it, but nonetheless here it is...

                \[
                \frac{1}{2}mv^2 -B\frac{m}{|\mathbf{r}|} = E_0
                \]
                \[
                \frac{1}{2}m(\dot{r}^2 + (r\dot{\theta})^2) -B\frac{m}{|\mathbf{r}|} = E_0
                \]
                \[
                \frac{1}{2}m(\dot{r}^2 + (r\frac{H_0}{mr^2})^2) -B\frac{m}{|\mathbf{r}|} = E_0
                \]
                \[
                r(\theta) = \frac{dr}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = \dot{r} = \frac{dr}{d\theta}\frac{H_0}{mr^2}
                \]
                \[
                \frac{1}{2}m((\frac{dr}{d\theta}\frac{H_0}{mr^2})^2 + (\frac{H_0}{mr})^2) -B\frac{m}{|\mathbf{r}|} = E_0
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay so now that we did whatever that was, now we are going to define the different paths orbiting bodies can make:

                \[
                r(\theta) = \frac{P}{1 + eCos(\theta - \phi)}
                \]
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                Where
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                Trajectory Paramater: \( P = \frac{H_0^2}{m^2B}\) 

            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center">
                Eccentricity: \( e = (1 + \frac{2E_0H_0^2}{m^3B^3} ) \) 

            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center">
                Offset Angle: \( \theta_i - Cos^\text{-1}(\frac{P - r_i}{er_i}) \)
            </p>
            <p>
                This equation defines "conic sections" in orbits.

            <p>
                When e = 0, the orbit is a circle
            </p>
            <p>
                When 0 < e < 1, the orbit is a ellipse
            </p>
            <p>
                When e = 1, the orbit is a parabola
            </p>
            <p>
                When e > 1, the orbit is a hyperbola
            </p>
