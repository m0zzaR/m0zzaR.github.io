            <h1>Gabriel Fonseca</h1>
            <p>
                I am an undergraduate majoring in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley.
                My current interest is in rocket propulsion, particularly bi-propellant liquid engines.
                I enjoy applying my knowledge of math and physics through running and programming dynamics simulations,
                and getting hands-on with manufacturing and machining parts.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have club experience with overall rocket design; avionics, propulsion, and simulations.
                I have also led the organization of various career fairs and other events geared towards aerospace enthusiasts.
            </p>
