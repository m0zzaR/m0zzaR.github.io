            <p> I am a Mechanical Engineer at UC Berkeley with a 
                dream to become an astronaut. I want to help humanity
                explore the solar system and universe beyond, whether 
                thats through Math, Phyics and Engineering, or through
                strapping myself to a rocket and blasting off this green rock.</p>
